2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file eddie-net-stylesheet.css is used to style the website, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
3. **Responsive Design**: The website includes a viewport meta tag to ensure it is responsive and looks good on different devices.
4. **Image Map**: An image map is used for the portrait image to create a clickable area that links to the "About" page.
